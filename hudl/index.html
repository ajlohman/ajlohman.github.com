				<p class="intro">The Hudl Manage Roster screen is in need of a redesign. Coaches need a better experience to add players to their roster, manage them, and see what they’re up to.</p>

				<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
				<p>Looking at how others have tackled similar problems is essential, and should be done in parallel with the Product Definition part of the process. I tried to find as many products with similar features/flows as I could. Having this analysis makes sure I’m not reinventing the wheel and identifies complex areas to be aware of as I started my design. </p>

				<h2>Map the flow</h2>
				<p>Assuming your work only affects a single page is like designing a house and assuming you won’t need doors, window or hallways. It doesn’t matter if you’re adding a button to a page or completely overhauling user on-boarding. There’s always a flow.</p>
				<p>The first thing I do when I start designing is write down the feature list, and using these features I develop the basic user flow of the design, which in most cases is the primary navigation. However, that was unnecessary in this case, since Hudl already has this figured out. The user flow should always be built in parallel with the most common use cases, so it accommodates to the way users will actually use the design, thus making its usage easier and clearly understandable.</p>
				<p>It’s important to try and create multiple user flows, test, and iterate. Often designers will create a first version of what they’re building and stick with it without exploring alternatives. That first version might be good at first sight, but without comparing with alternatives, it won’t show its flaws and drawbacks.</p>

				<p>I went ahead and drew this user flow along with some common use cases. The “Manage Roster” features are laid out in a very straightforward way.</p>
				<p>We have:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Add Athlete, is the way to add/import/export athletes from the roster</li>
					<li>Filter Roster, is the way to filter the roster by seasons or positions</li>
					<li>Roster List, is the view of every athlete on the roster with the ability to edit/archive/delete roster members</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The use cases depict different kinds of activities when using the manage roster screen. Be it adding athletes to the roster, filter through the roster and just viewing the current roster. </p>
